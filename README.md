Brammm\MenuBundle
===================

A menu bundle that's very themeable. (*)

*\*: Not yet fully finished*


## Install

Via Composer (the bundle isn't added to Packagist just yet, so you have to add the repository manually):

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "url": "https://github.com/Brammm/MenuBundle.git",
            "type": "git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "brammm/menu-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
}
```
